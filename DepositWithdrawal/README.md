# Deposit and Withdrawal

In order to ensure the anonymous transfer of VOTO and ETH from the Ethereum account containing the VOTO token to a new Ethereum account, it will be developed a system that makes reference to the protocol implemented by Tornado Cash.

The Voting Organiser will deploy the smart contract pool for the deposit and withdrawal of ETH and VOTO. This smart contract will allow deposits to be made from the original Ethereum account and then withdrawals on the new Ethereum account. 

Users who have obtained the VOTO token and wish to vote, in order to do so anonymously, will then have to first perform these two steps: deposit and withdrawal via the smart contract pool of ETH and VOTO.

The user who has made the deposit, upon successful completion of the transaction will receive in output a private note that he must necessarily store in order to be able to later retrieve the amount deposited.
