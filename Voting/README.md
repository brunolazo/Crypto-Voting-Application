# Voting

The Voting Organiser will implement a web dApp that allows the user to vote. Once the smart contract has been deployed, a web application will be developed to communicate with it.

The procedure involves the voter logging into his MetaMask account, in which he will have configured his new Ethereum account. The user will then perform a transaction that allows the dApp to transfer his VOTO token to the voting smart contract, once this is done the user can select the candidate he wishes to vote for from the web page and finally confirm his vote.
